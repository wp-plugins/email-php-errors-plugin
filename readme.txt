Catches php errors, and reports last 25. Can also email the results. Good for debugging themes and plugins.

== Description ==
This plugin was intended for developers who need to view errors generated by PHP. It sets an error handling function, but makes no attempt to alter other default conditions and reporting conditions within PHP. It is capable of reporting any error that the PHP environment handles. The plugin returns control to the precious PHP error handlers when it has recorded the error.

This plugin will not be useful for the casual user and can actually generate so many email notifications as to be dangerous. 

The mail functionality can be utilized by entering a valid email address in the settings area of the plugin. A blank email will result in no emails being sent. Be careful about setting the default error level to include all errors. There are a huge number of notices generated by plugins and themes and even the Wordpress core.

The plugin will track the last 25 errors and display them on the settings page.

This uses the default PHP mail function, so if your PHP installation is not configured for mail this will not work. The plugin does not check the validity of the email because it is intended for users who can type a valid email address and know the consequences of using this plugin.

The errors to report can be set to only report Errors, only report Errors and Warnings, or report all, including notices and even strict and deprecated notices, depending on your version of PHP and how it is configured.

From PHP documentation:
The following error types cannot be handled with a user defined function: E_ERROR, E_PARSE, E_CORE_ERROR, E_CORE_WARNING, E_COMPILE_ERROR, E_COMPILE_WARNING, and most of E_STRICT raised in the file where set_error_handler() is called. 


== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin.
2. Upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins directory.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Set tour email and reporting options in Settings/Email PHP Errors.
